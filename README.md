# Aerospike quiesce script for GCP maintenance events

Based off of Google's own metadata [example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/blob/master/compute/metadata/main.py),
this script will drain Aerospike nodes when the node gets a maintenance event.

A maintenance event typically means the VM will be live migrated. This plays havoc with Aerospike.
To mitigate the impact, the node will be drained via the `asinfo -v quiesce` command once a maintenance event is scheduled.

# Requirements

python requests 2.20.1
asinfo (from aerospike-tools)


# Running

This script should run on every Aerospike node, as maintenance events are local to each VM.

run with nohup:

```
nohup ./maintenance.py &
```

# Parameters:

```
usage: maintenance.py [-h] [-o OPTIONS] [-p | -n]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OPTIONS, --options OPTIONS
                        Additional options to pass into asinfo. Can be
                        anything except commands, ie: "-v $COMMAND". Entire
                        string must be quoted, eg: -o="-u admin -p admin"
  -p, --persist         Persist the last event to file
  -n, --non-persist     Disable persist the last event to file (default)

```


Example with user/password:

```
nohup ./maintenance.py -o="-u admin -p admin" &
```
